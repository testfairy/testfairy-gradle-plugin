TestFairy Gradle Plugin
-------------------

This plugin integrates TestFairy platform with the Gradle build system. With this plugin, you can upload signed builds directly via command line, IntelliJ, Android Studio and other IDEs.

Installation
---------

A typical TestFairy Gradle Plugin installation takes less than 20 seconds. Installation consists of adding the following to your ***build.gradle*** file:

 1. Add the TestFairy Maven repository:

        maven { url 'https://www.testfairy.com/maven' }
    
 2. Add plugin dependency: 

        classpath 'com.testfairy.plugins.gradle:testfairy:1.+'

 3. Apply plugin:

        apply plugin: 'testfairy'

 4. Configure your TestFairy API key by adding this to your "*android*" section: (Your TestFairy API key is in your account settings)

        testfairyConfig {
            apiKey "1234567890abcdef"
        }

Complete Example
----------------

For convenience, here is a snippet of a complete ***build.gradle*** file, including the additions above.

    buildscript {
        repositories {
            mavenCentral()
            maven { url 'https://www.testfairy.com/maven' }
        }
    
        dependencies {
            classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:0.6'
            classpath 'com.testfairy.plugins.gradle:testfairy:1.+'
        }
    }
    
    apply plugin: 'android'
    apply plugin: 'testfairy'
    
    android {
        testfairyConfig {
            apiKey "1234567890abcdef"
        }
    }


Usage
-----

With the plugin installed, a set of new tasks, prefixed "*testfairy*" will be added, one for each build type.

For example: to upload a debug build, run the following from terminal:

    gradlew testfairyDebug
    
Optionally, you can add a *changelog* to this build. This changelog will appear in your build notes and as a default message when inviting testers. For example:

    gradlew -PtestfairyChangelog="Fixed all bugs" testfairyDebug
    
Additional Parameters
---------------------

By default, the Gradle plugin will record all metrics, of highest quality video at 1 frames per second. However, all of these are available through build.gradle configuration. Please consider the following example:

    android {
        testfairyConfig {
            metrics "cpu,memory,network,logcat"
            video "wifi"
            videoRate "0.5"
            videoQuality "low"
            maxDuration "15m"
            recordOnBackground true
            iconWatermark true
            testersGroups "dev,qa,friends"
            notify true
            maxDuration "1h"
            autoUpdate true
            uploadProguardMapping true
        }
    }
    
The example above will make sure TestFairy records a low quality video, at a frame every 2 seconds, only if wifi is available. Max session duration for video is 15 minutes, and only cpu, memory, network and logcat metrics are recorded. And watermark will be added to the icon to distinguish TestFairy builds. Previous builds will be automatically updated to latest versions and recorded sessions are capped at 1 hour. Some testers will be invited automatically, and notifications will be sent by email.
